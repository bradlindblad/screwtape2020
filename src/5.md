SUBJECT: Something for you to try...

Dear Mugwort,

I see that you've been able to keep your human in a state of despair for some time now. Excellent! I'm proud of you. In fact, I brought you up in a meeting at corporate last week. We were discussing additions to our young professionals networking program, and I touted you, Mugwort, as a worthy addition to the group. It's a great program for building your career -- and a fast track to an lower management role. Would you rather spend eternity whispering, suggesting, begging these filthy creatures to sink down into our miry pit, or would you rather call the shots at corporate with me? strategizing and building the future of the Underworld? Down here, my scaly apprentice, the muck is always blacker.

Now I've come across some research that points to more opportunities opening up for us on earth. One of our greatest ancillary weapons since VG Day (Victory in the Garden) has been *pharmakeia*, the cutting of roots -- drugs as the humans say. Recently, the humans have went from demonizing (ha) psychedelics -- our most useful drug -- to praising it; even referring to it as *medicine*. 

You see, ever since the second great war, science has been largely compromised on earth. As soon as the military funnelled untold millions into the university system to support the war, science was no longer Newton, or Pastuer, or Pascal, it was bought -- a commodity if you will. Science had a taste of the wine, the sturporous drunkenness, and her eyes were filled with purple and scarlet. 

As such, we've been able to bribe the researchers and scientists to find some positive uses for these drugs to treat certain ailments, like anxiety and depression. This provides a peek through the window shades to one of our underlying strategies that has been so effective, which is of course to introduce a barb such as LSD or DMT or marijuana in a way that the negative effects are almost ignored in favor of the positive effects. *This marijuana will help my nausea, so what if I get a little paranoid?* The beauty of a barbed tool such a this is that it slides in easily, but is nearly impossible to pull out. 

Your patient is young, he thinks himself smart. He is part of the crowd who looks down his nose at prescription medication, which he sees as part of the corporate machine designed to poison him. This is why I think he'll be likely to try something like pot if a friend offers it. I mean, hell, it's legal in half the country now, maybe all you need to do is to get him on a road trip with his buddies? However you do it, make it seem like an "organic" experience; marijuana grows in nature, so how could it be bad? His own God even said that he has been given "every plant for food?" These lukewarm Christians can't be tempted into trying these things in the same way as the others, who still fall for the original trick: that their "eyes will be opened" so that they'll be like the Enemy. 

When and if you are able to get this hook into the lad, a few things will happen. First, you will have *direct access* to him. No longer will you be forced to whisper so subtly to him, you can have a conversation with him and control parts of his senses almost directly. With marijuana, that direct connection is a little unstable, compared to the high speed internet that we can ride on with some of the stronger drugs. There exists a small handful of drugs that allow us almost unlimited control of the lucky patient for a few minutes at a time. A few minutes might seem like a trifle, but in those few minutes he's in *our world*, where time is ours to meld how we see fit. 

But nevertheless, I don't need to explain to you why this is such a great tactic. We practically overran America  in the 1960's when these things came into the mainstream, but at that time there was still a stigma, which would have prevented your patient, if he lived then, from indulging. With the help of one type of drug, we conquered Europe in the 1940's, and used that Austrian saint as our lever. Indeed, this tactic will make you feel like Archimedes once you see how well it works! An extremely popular podcaster in America has been a great advocate for these drugs as of late. He's one of the leading voices that young men *really* listen to, so of course we had our top demons on him like stink on pigs. When we can influence these celebrities our reach can be compounded a thousand-fold. 

In addition to the first rate access to patient that you'll be able to gain with these substances coursing through your patient's veins, numerous secondary effects can also work to our advantage.

First of all, many of these drugs will make your man plain lazy -- sloth. Let him spend his life laying around and you'll be sure to make his displease the enemy. Next, you can fill him with incredible amounts of fear as he drifts from his world into ours. Of course, try not to make him afraid the first few times; get him hooked before the sugar turns to vingar. 

You may be happy to learn that humans share a most miserable trait with us: that inability to be satisfied (after you win your first soul, you'll know what I'm talking about.) If you give them x amount of a drug, they will eventually need x + 1 to get the same level of arousal, and then x + 2, and so on. This is a beauty because they will never be satisfied with anything on this earth. As they try to chase the elusive high that first hooked them, they become more and more focused on *self*. The more they focus inward, the easier our job becomes. The worship of *self* is the same as the worship of our Great Father Below. 

Get him here, Mugwort, and you'll be well on your way.
