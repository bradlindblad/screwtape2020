Mugwort,

Your report on the patients screen time is encouraging. There is the one case where these humans knowingly waste their time watching silly cat videos, football games, and other trivial track. But your patient has fairly deceived himself with juicy justifications for the hours he spends on his phone, rather than with his family or communing with the Enemy. Your patient believes that his screen time is *better* than the screen time of his friends because he is consulting his fitness tracking apps to create better health for himself, and he is reading scholarly articles in his spare time on his phone to further his career, which in turn helps him support his family.

You see mugwort, these rationalizations that the humans are so fond of are among the silliest behaviors our enemy puts up with. Whether your patient detaches himself from his family due to a seemingly positive distraction rather than an Inane distraction, The point is that he is distracted.

A secondary benefit of the patients constant smart phone research is the gradual breakdown of his own reason. Instead of logically thinking from first principles, the patient read articles written by people that have regurgitated ideas written by people that have heard ideas from our souls in our university systems. It really is a game of telephone Afton originating from our very own talking points. 

All of this is to say that you must create an inseparable bond between the patient and his phone and any other similar devices.

I’m very pleased to hear your description of the flaccid church he’s been attending lately.One of our boys has been working on that churches lead pastor for more than a decade, And it’s evident that he’s had a breakthrough.  one way we measure this is by  Counting  the times a pastor
