<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>I obtained the following email archive quite by chance. While at a conference in San Francisco, I spied among the abundant street garbage, that familiar forbidden fruit encircled with a sheet of silver that could only belong to one brand of popular computer. I carefully walked over to the thing to find a laptop in severe disrepair, apparently discarded by its owner. I shoved it into my bag and walked on.</p>
<p>Once back in the office, I found the hard drive to be still operational, and the email correspondences of its previous owner are what you're about to read.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I read <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> by C.S. Lewis early on as a Christian. Screwtape's pointed advice to his young and naive nephew Wormwood opened my mind to the classic and contemporary methods the Enemy uses to turn us away from Christ, however slowly or innocuously. As I studied the email archives, I found it fascinating how the Enemy's tactics have morphed since Lewis discovered the original letters in the 1940's. Not only are the devils now using email rather than snail mail, but they have developed tactics that would have been an impossibility decades ago, and they make the methods deployed in Lewis's time seem almost childish. The human foibles and weaknesses that these methods exploit, however, haven't changed and they will never change.</p>
<p>I find it quite interesting that the devils must navigate emails the same way you and I do on a daily basis. As you will see, IT support seems to be lacking in the certain catacomb of Hell Screwtape and tk reside in, and perhaps the presence of emails in our earthly realm may just be another way that the Enemy makes his presence known to us.</p>
