<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>I obtained the following email archive quite by chance while at a conference in Southern California. I spied among the street litter that familiar forbidden fruit logo etched into a silver casing, which could only belong to a Mac laptop. I carefully walked over to the pile of trash to find an laptop in severe disrepair, apparently discarded by the past owner. I looked around me for an owner, and, when seeing no one who fit the bill, I shoved it into my bag and moved on.</p>
<p>Once back in the office, I found the hard drive still operational, and the email correspondence of its previous owner is what you're about to read.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I've read <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> by C.S. Lewis. The senior devil Screwtape's pointed advice to his young and nieve nephew Wormwood opened my mind to the methods the Enemy uses to turn us away from Christ, however slowly or innocuously. As I studied the email archives, I found it fascinating how the Enemy's tactics have changed since Lewis discovered the original letters in the 1940's. Not only are the devils now using email and other forms of communication, but they have developed tactics that would have been an impossibility decades ago. Indeed, the methods employed today make the tools available to Wormwood so long ago seem like children's toys. The human foibles and weaknesses that these methods exploit, however, have not changed and will never change. We will always be prideful, lustful, violent.</p>
<p>I find it satisfying that the devils must navigate the mundane aspects of corporate life the same way we have do; emails, meetings and the like. As you will see, IT support seems to be lacking in the catacomb of Hell that Screwtape and his new pupil, Mugwort, reside in. Perhaps the fact that we and the devils both have to use these technologies illustrates how much control the Evil One actually already has in our world.</p>

SUBJECT: RE: New Patient Alert</p>
<p>Mugwort,</p>
<p>I received the new patient alert you forwarded from corporate. This new patient of yours is a rare fellow, eh? Twenty two years old, raised in the Enemy's church, repentant, etc. By all infernal standards, this one is firmly encamped with our tormenter -- a rare disposition in this age. Difficult tasks like the one facing you are what make legends out of young devils like yourself. The greater the pride, the harder the fall, as a past master once said.</p>
<p>I encourage you to immediately deploy our most highly-developed tool at once: inane and continual distraction. Our science folks have poured billions into the Distractive Arts over the past 40 years. No more will amatuers like yourself have to deal with &quot;thinking&quot; patients, like the one your cousin Wormwood failed many years ago. We have found that once a patient becomes fully addicted to short-term, episodic stimuli, the war is nearly over. In this hypotized state, the patient cannot focus on one thought for much longer than eight seconds, sometimes even half that can be a stretch.</p>
<p>Prayer, the most insufferable communique that our Enemy continually debases himself with, is all but guaranteed to desist when the patient's thoughts begin to resemble a loose bag of marbles.</p>
<p>What is his current involvement with his church? Please send me all details of his involvement at once so we can get ahead of that problem quickly. His attachment to a community of &quot;believers&quot; such as himself is the biggest obstacle we face at this point. As you may remember from school, He makes himself present when only a few of them gather, which makes our job hellaciously difficult. But you'll be happy to learn that our devils in Marketing have rendered large swaths of these American churches ineffective and totally void of His presence. Through cutting edge societal pressures and infiltration, many of these groups are actually well within our nest while remaining ignorant to the fact that they are serving the wrong god. Nevertheless, there are still dangerous churches out there that, if left unchecked, can completely surround a patient with an impenetrable fog of Grace that we are powerless against. So beware.</p>
<p>Let me further illustrate how the distraction techniques are applied. From a very young age -- sometimes immediately after birth -- we bombard the humans with our greatest weapon of conversion: screens. Be it television, streaming movies or even video games, all of these screens make our jobs a helluva lot easier. Screens have even displaced music (our leader's favorite) as our most popular medium for placing messages in their silly little heads. Now Mugwort, remember that these mortals have a finite amount of space in their brains, so the more real estate our propaganda can occupy, the less room our enemy has to work with. I should note that the cruft we place in the patient's head need not be officially sanctioned material to be effective. Any content that distracts the human from the Enemy is good content.</p>
<p>At any rate, we begin to distract the kids as early as possible. Their parents can actually be our biggest allies in this since they can plop their kids in front of a screen to gather time for <em>themselves.</em> Remember that this isn't a race; we have access to almost all people for countless hours every day for most of their lives to use this trick for our good -- don't rush it, you don't need to.</p>
<p>When the children begin to reach puberty, they become highly susceptible to two kinds of specialized screen attacks: sexual imagery and FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out. Our scientists have discovered that sexual imagery placed in front of these human teenagers during one of the peak hormonal stages can induce lifelong addictions to our most debauched visual media. Find out if your patient fell into that camp when he was younger so we can possibly exploit it further.</p>
<p>Now FOMO is a relatively new tactic. Not that humans didn't occasionally hear of a social gathering they weren't invited to in olden days, and experienced grief because of it. Far from it. But now, with the new technologies, any human anywhere in the world can be exposed to millions of other people who have it better than them. A teenager can go on social media and see <em>all</em> the parties they weren't invited to or an adult can take a virtual tour of a celebritie's mansion (you can almost taste the jealousy!) All of these things are good for us. When we can convince our patients to strive for worldly things entirely, this job becomes almost too easy.</p>
<p>I'll see you at the pot luck next week.</p>

SUBJECT: RE:RE: New Patient Alert</p>
<p>Mugwort,</p>
<p>Your report on the patients screen time is encouraging. There is the one case where these humans knowingly waste their time watching silly cat videos, football games, and other trivial track. But your patient has fairly deceived himself with juicy justifications for the hours he spends on his phone, rather than with his family or communing with the Enemy. Your patient believes that his screen time is <em>better</em> than the screen time of his friends because he is consulting his fitness tracking apps to create better health for himself, and he is reading scholarly articles in his spare time on his phone to further his career, which in turn helps him support his family.</p>
<p>Obviously. we need to encourage this behavior at all costs. Whenever your patient creates a distinction between himself and those close to him, he invites the opportunity for our greatest sin to enter his heart: Pride.</p>
<p>If your patient glances over at someone in the pew and sees them scrolling through a program that he deems <em>less than</em>, that's perfect. Not only will the installation of Pride distance him from the Enemy (He really detests it!), the bloody fool doesn't even know that he's deceiving himself. He rationalizes his screen time because he views it as constructive.</p>
<p>You see mugwort, these rationalizations that the humans are so fond of are among the silliest behaviors our Enemy puts up with. Whether your patient detaches himself from his family due to a seemingly positive distraction rather than an Inane distraction, The point is that he is distracted.</p>
<p>Now, regarding your report on his current church. I say &quot;current&quot; because we need to encourage him to shop around for a new church as often as possible. This church hopping works to our advantage in two ways. First, it transforms our patient's view of the church from a community into a commodity. As you know, these Christians are increasingly hard to reach when they enmesh with one another, forming an impenetrable web of life.</p>
<p>It's much easier for a soldier to pick off another lone soldier in no-man's-land, than it is for one to snipe an entire charging battalion of men. So when we prevent these people from assimilating deeply into one church body, it is easier for you and I to uproot them from the sand.</p>
<p>Next, we can easily pull the wandering sould closer to our breast by confusing him with the different denominations that man has established. If your patient is dissatisfied with his church, more than likely from a personal disagreement with a church member or sermon, you can point his attention to how &quot;all these so-and-so's are all the same,&quot; thus producing a mark on the heads of everyone in that church. Therafter, you can truly confuse the man on his theology by instigating this pettiness towards these churches. Eventually, he will run out of denominations to alienate himself from and will have no other choice but to come into our arms!</p>
<p>It doesn't always work that smooth, but you get the picture. Remind me to tell you about how we further confuse the humans with the translations of their Bible.</p>
<p>Back to his current church. I pinged human resources and found the tempter working on his current pastor. Now, although I just told you to have your man shop around, I think we need to keep him where he is for now, as I see some opportunities on the horizon.</p>
<p>This other tempter has put in a solid decade on this pastor and it appears to be paying off. Recall my previous letter expounding on the utmost importance of screentime. This pastor is no stranger to it, and the fellow spends much of his time watching sermons by what he views as &quot;big time&quot; preachers -- the one's we're so fond of. These pastors don't become big time in the World by preaching the Truth about us or our Enemy; far from it. Our fellow's pastor has been slowly integrating the theology of these prosperity teachers into his own lessons; probably without awareness.</p>
<p>Less teaching on repentence an our Enemy, and more talk of <em>self</em>. This vein of teaching is obviously straight from our playbook, so keep him at his church for now, Stalin willing.</p>
<p>Talk soon,</p>

TO: Mugwort <code>&lt;muggy_as@hell.org&gt;</code><br />
SUBJECT: Something for you to try...</p>
<p>Dear Mugwort,</p>
<p>I see that you've been able to keep your human in a state of despair for some time now. Excellent! I'm proud of you. In fact, I brought you up in a meeting at corporate last week. We were discussing additions to our young professionals networking program, and I touted you, Mugwort, as a worthy addition to the group. It's a great program for building your career -- and a fast track to a lower management role. Would you rather spend eternity whispering, suggesting, begging these filthy creatures to sink down into our miry pit, or would you rather call the shots at corporate with me? strategizing and building the future of the Underworld? Down here, my scaly apprentice, the muck is always blacker.</p>
<p>I've come across some research that points to more opportunities opening up for us on earth. One of our greatest ancillary weapons since VG Day (Victory in the Garden) has been <em>pharmakeia</em>, the cutting of roots -- drugs as the humans say. Recently, the humans have went from demonizing psychedelics -- our most useful drug -- to praising it; even referring to it as <em>medicine</em>. Hahaha.</p>
<p>You may rightly wonder why the humans have changed their tune on something they have universally shunned for so long. It started after the second great war when science was largely compromised on earth. As soon as the military funnelled untold millions into the university system to support the war, science was no longer Newton, or Pastuer, or Pascal, it was a commodity; bought and sold like politicians. Science and scientists had a taste of the wine, the sturporous drunkenness, and their eyes were filled with purple and scarlet.</p>
<p>Since then, we've been able to bribe the researchers and scientists to find some positive uses for these drugs to treat certain ailments, like anxiety and depression. This provides a peek through the window shades to one of our underlying strategies that has been so effective, which is of course to introduce a barb such as LSD or DMT or marijuana in a way that the negative effects are initially ignored in favor of the positive effects. <em>This marijuana will help my nausea, so what if I get a little paranoid?</em> The beauty of a barbed tool such a this is that it slides in easily, but the nasty stuff stays with the patient long after they try to pry it out.</p>
<p>Your patient is young, he thinks himself smart. He is part of the crowd who looks down his nose at prescription medication, which he sees as part of the corporate machine designed to poison him. This is why I think he'll be likely to try something like pot if a friend offers it. I mean, hell, it's legal in half the country now, maybe all you need to do is wait for a road trip with his buddies and use the old peer pressure tricks.</p>
<p>However you do it, make it seem like an &quot;organic&quot; experience; marijuana grows in nature, so how could it be bad? It's been used for 1000's of years in indigenous cultures; it's the wicked Victorian Europeans and American Puritans who wanted to hide the truth from the masses! His own God even said that he has been given &quot;every plant for food?&quot;</p>
<p>These lukewarm Christians can't be tempted into trying these things in the same way as the others, who still fall for the original trick: that their &quot;eyes will be opened&quot; so that they'll be like the Enemy. But remember that your young patient <em>has a choice</em>. He has to choose these things, choose to disobey the Enemy in order to choose us. And when he hears the stories of healing from these drugs in hip ceremonies in South America or down the street, he'll make the right choice. We've already grabbed most of the internet celebrities your patient looks up to. As soon as he hears that podcaster so-and-so had his life changed by a &quot;religuos experience&quot; with a shaman, it will be hard for him to resist. He's young and niaive enough to not be able to discern the difference between experiencing our nauseating Enemy firsthand and experiencing you and I,and by the time he finds out, it will be too late for him anyway.</p>
<p>When and if you are able to get this hook into the lad, a few things will happen. First, you will have <em>direct access</em> to him. No longer will you be forced to whisper so subtly to him, you can have a conversation with him and control parts of his senses almost directly. With marijuana, that direct connection is a little unstable, compared to the high speed connection we enjoy with some of the stronger drugs. There exists a small handful of these that allow us almost unlimited control of the lucky patient for a few minutes at a time. A few minutes might seem like a trifle, but in those few minutes he's in <em>our world</em>, where time is ours to meld how we see fit. While he's in this state we can see his entire past, therefore it is easy for us to dig up some relevant nugget of repressed memory, spin it around a bit, and make it seem like the patient had a &quot;breakthrough&quot; -- a good word to get him used to, by the way.</p>
<p>The other thing is that you can have a bit of fun with him. Scare him, find his greatest fear and make him experience it over and over again. Give him a taste of what death is like. Once he steps through that portal, the laws of time and space don't apply in that space you share with him. Some veteran tempters view this as their version of school recess that they enjoyed as young spirits. Live a little, Mugwort!</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! Numerous secondary effects can also work to our advantage.</p>
<p>First of all, many of these drugs will make your man plain lazy -- sloth. Let him spend his life laying around and you'll be sure to make his displease the enemy. Next, you can fill him with incredible amounts of fear as he drifts from his world into ours. Of course, try not to make him afraid the first few times; get him hooked before the sugar turns to vingar.</p>
<p>You may be happy to learn that humans share a most miserable trait with us: that inability to be satisfied (after you win your first soul, you'll know what I'm talking about.) If you give them x amount of a drug, they will eventually need x + 1 to get the same level of arousal, and then x + 2, and so on. This is a beauty because they will never be satisfied with anything on this earth. As they try to chase the elusive high that first hooked them, they become more and more focused on <em>self</em>. The more they focus inward, the easier our job becomes. The worship of <em>self</em> is the same as the worship of our Great Father Below.</p>
<p>Get him to try it, Mugwort, and you'll be well on your way.</p>
