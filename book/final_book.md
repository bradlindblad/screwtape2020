Preface
=======

I obtained the following email archive quite by chance while at a
conference in Southern California. I spied among the street litter that
familiar forbidden fruit logo etched into a silver casing, which could
only belong to a Mac laptop. I carefully walked over to the pile of
trash to find an laptop in severe disrepair, apparently discarded by the
past owner. I looked around me for an owner, and, when seeing no one who
fit the bill, I shoved it into my bag and moved on.

Once back in the office, I found the hard drive still operational, and
the email correspondence of its previous owner is what you're about to
read.

Like many of you, I've read *The Screwtape Letters* by C.S. Lewis. The
senior devil Screwtape's pointed advice to his young and nieve nephew
Wormwood opened my mind to the methods the Enemy uses to turn us away
from Christ, however slowly or innocuously. As I studied the email
archives, I found it fascinating how the Enemy's tactics have changed
since Lewis discovered the original letters in the 1940's. Not only are
the devils now using email and other forms of communication, but they
have developed tactics that would have been an impossibility decades
ago. Indeed, the methods employed today make the tools available to
Wormwood so long ago seem like children's toys. The human foibles and
weaknesses that these methods exploit, however, have not changed and
will never change. We will always be prideful, lustful, violent.

I find it satisfying that the devils must navigate the mundane aspects
of corporate life the same way we have do; emails, meetings and the
like. As you will see, IT support seems to be lacking in the catacomb of
Hell that Screwtape and his new pupil, Mugwort, reside in. Perhaps the
fact that we and the devils both have to use these technologies
illustrates how much control the Evil One actually already has in our
world.

SUBJECT: RE: New Patient Alert

Mugwort,

I received the new patient alert you forwarded from corporate. This new
patient of yours is a rare fellow, eh? Twenty two years old, raised in
the Enemy's church, repentant, etc. By all infernal standards, this one
is firmly encamped with our tormenter -- a rare disposition in this age.
Difficult tasks like the one facing you are what make legends out of
young devils like yourself. The greater the pride, the harder the fall,
as a past master once said.

I encourage you to immediately deploy our most highly-developed tool at
once: inane and continual distraction. Our science folks have poured
billions into the Distractive Arts over the past 40 years. No more will
amatuers like yourself have to deal with "thinking" patients, like the
one your cousin Wormwood failed many years ago. We have found that once
a patient becomes fully addicted to short-term, episodic stimuli, the
war is nearly over. In this hypotized state, the patient cannot focus on
one thought for much longer than eight seconds, sometimes even half that
can be a stretch.

Prayer, the most insufferable communique that our Enemy continually
debases himself with, is all but guaranteed to desist when the patient's
thoughts begin to resemble a loose bag of marbles.

What is his current involvement with his church? Please send me all
details of his involvement at once so we can get ahead of that problem
quickly. His attachment to a community of "believers" such as himself is
the biggest obstacle we face at this point. As you may remember from
school, He makes himself present when only a few of them gather, which
makes our job hellaciously difficult. But you'll be happy to learn that
our devils in Marketing have rendered large swaths of these American
churches ineffective and totally void of His presence. Through cutting
edge societal pressures and infiltration, many of these groups are
actually well within our nest while remaining ignorant to the fact that
they are serving the wrong god. Nevertheless, there are still dangerous
churches out there that, if left unchecked, can completely surround a
patient with an impenetrable fog of Grace that we are powerless against.
So beware.

Let me further illustrate how the distraction techniques are applied.
From a very young age -- sometimes immediately after birth -- we bombard
the humans with our greatest weapon of conversion: screens. Be it
television, streaming movies or even video games, all of these screens
make our jobs a helluva lot easier. Screens have even displaced music
(our leader's favorite) as our most popular medium for placing messages
in their silly little heads. Now Mugwort, remember that these mortals
have a finite amount of space in their brains, so the more real estate
our propaganda can occupy, the less room our enemy has to work with. I
should note that the cruft we place in the patient's head need not be
officially sanctioned material to be effective. Any content that
distracts the human from the Enemy is good content.

At any rate, we begin to distract the kids as early as possible. Their
parents can actually be our biggest allies in this since they can plop
their kids in front of a screen to gather time for *themselves.*
Remember that this isn't a race; we have access to almost all people for
countless hours every day for most of their lives to use this trick for
our good -- don't rush it, you don't need to.

When the children begin to reach puberty, they become highly susceptible
to two kinds of specialized screen attacks: sexual imagery and FOMO, or
Fear of Missing Out. Our scientists have discovered that sexual imagery
placed in front of these human teenagers during one of the peak hormonal
stages can induce lifelong addictions to our most debauched visual
media. Find out if your patient fell into that camp when he was younger
so we can possibly exploit it further.

Now FOMO is a relatively new tactic. Not that humans didn't occasionally
hear of a social gathering they weren't invited to in olden days, and
experienced grief because of it. Far from it. But now, with the new
technologies, any human anywhere in the world can be exposed to millions
of other people who have it better than them. A teenager can go on
social media and see *all* the parties they weren't invited to or an
adult can take a virtual tour of a celebritie's mansion (you can almost
taste the jealousy!) All of these things are good for us. When we can
convince our patients to strive for worldly things entirely, this job
becomes almost too easy.

I'll see you at the pot luck next week.

SUBJECT: RE:RE: New Patient Alert

Mugwort,

Your report on the patients screen time is encouraging. There is the one
case where these humans knowingly waste their time watching silly cat
videos, football games, and other trivial track. But your patient has
fairly deceived himself with juicy justifications for the hours he
spends on his phone, rather than with his family or communing with the
Enemy. Your patient believes that his screen time is *better* than the
screen time of his friends because he is consulting his fitness tracking
apps to create better health for himself, and he is reading scholarly
articles in his spare time on his phone to further his career, which in
turn helps him support his family.

Obviously. we need to encourage this behavior at all costs. Whenever
your patient creates a distinction between himself and those close to
him, he invites the opportunity for our greatest sin to enter his heart:
Pride.

If your patient glances over at someone in the pew and sees them
scrolling through a program that he deems *less than*, that's perfect.
Not only will the installation of Pride distance him from the Enemy (He
really detests it!), the bloody fool doesn't even know that he's
deceiving himself. He rationalizes his screen time because he views it
as constructive.

You see mugwort, these rationalizations that the humans are so fond of
are among the silliest behaviors our Enemy puts up with. Whether your
patient detaches himself from his family due to a seemingly positive
distraction rather than an Inane distraction, The point is that he is
distracted.

Now, regarding your report on his current church. I say "current"
because we need to encourage him to shop around for a new church as
often as possible. This church hopping works to our advantage in two
ways. First, it transforms our patient's view of the church from a
community into a commodity. As you know, these Christians are
increasingly hard to reach when they enmesh with one another, forming an
impenetrable web of life.

It's much easier for a soldier to pick off another lone soldier in
no-man's-land, than it is for one to snipe an entire charging battalion
of men. So when we prevent these people from assimilating deeply into
one church body, it is easier for you and I to uproot them from the
sand.

Next, we can easily pull the wandering sould closer to our breast by
confusing him with the different denominations that man has established.
If your patient is dissatisfied with his church, more than likely from a
personal disagreement with a church member or sermon, you can point his
attention to how "all these so-and-so's are all the same," thus
producing a mark on the heads of everyone in that church. Therafter, you
can truly confuse the man on his theology by instigating this pettiness
towards these churches. Eventually, he will run out of denominations to
alienate himself from and will have no other choice but to come into our
arms!

It doesn't always work that smooth, but you get the picture. Remind me
to tell you about how we further confuse the humans with the
translations of their Bible.

Back to his current church. I pinged human resources and found the
tempter working on his current pastor. Now, although I just told you to
have your man shop around, I think we need to keep him where he is for
now, as I see some opportunities on the horizon.

This other tempter has put in a solid decade on this pastor and it
appears to be paying off. Recall my previous letter expounding on the
utmost importance of screentime. This pastor is no stranger to it, and
the fellow spends much of his time watching sermons by what he views as
"big time" preachers -- the one's we're so fond of. These pastors don't
become big time in the World by preaching the Truth about us or our
Enemy; far from it. Our fellow's pastor has been slowly integrating the
theology of these prosperity teachers into his own lessons; probably
without awareness.

Less teaching on repentence an our Enemy, and more talk of *self*. This
vein of teaching is obviously straight from our playbook, so keep him at
his church for now, Stalin willing.

Talk soon,

SUBJECT: RE:RE: xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Since the college faculty, in their infinite evil, seemingly cannot
teach you anything useful, I'll do their job for them.

You asked about suggesting your patient try out another religion
entirely distinct from his current one. At first glance, this may appear
to be a valid tack, but in this case, it would be a waste of your time.
In decaded past, before the people of the world were connected by our
screens and the internet, a young girl in Kansas hadn't the foggiest
idea what a girl in China worshipped, or what holy book a boy in Africa
would regard. So when this Kansas girl grew up and went to college, she
had context at all when introduced to buddhism by some girl she meets in
chemistry class. With no preconceived notions on what buddhism is, it
was entirely possible for a tempter to suggest that her parents and
pastor had "kept her in the dark" about this "true" religion.

In addition, the only source of information she would have about
buddhism would be her friend's words and maybe an article in a dusty
encyclopedia. You see, the internet has both helped and hurt us as
tempters. These cases of naive-turned-convert are increasingly rare, but
not unheard-of.

Your patient is a product of the internet age. He has been told of the
other religions his entire life, especially by his pastor. In his puny
little mind, buddhism already equates to *us*. Now I'll tell you what
you should do instead.

The trick is to get your patient *comfortable*. Get him cozy, get him
lacksadaisacal, get him happy with his place in the world, and happy in
his relationship to our Enemy. You must at all costs, keep him from
reading Paul's warning to him; convince him it's OK to be static in his
relationship to the Enemy. Remind him that he went to Sunday school, was
baptized, that he randomly thows a five dollar bill in the offering --
he's checking all the boxes he's required to. At least, all the boxes he
sees his friends checking.

While it may seem like you're batting for the other team for years by
doing this, it willpay off. As we've discussed, we have a whole division
that's been making great progress on the pastors in this country. Sooner
or later, your cozy patient's pastor may turn to us (and there has been
good evidence that he's headed that way.) As long as your patient is
kept comfy, he'll turn as well.

Why rock the boat? So what if there is less and less Jesus and more and
more "community" in the weekly sermon? Wouldn't Jesus encourage that?
Before he knows it, there will be no Jesus, and he's slid down into our
morass.

If your cozy Christian continues down this path we're trotting him down,
we can eventually turn him completely, and here's why. These "mere"
concessions the patient makes for his faith have an additive effect. By
this I mean that each concession he makes builds on the previous, and
each sucessive concession becomes easier than the last to take.

We exploit a defect that the Enemy carelessly left in the humans when he
designed them. You see, when a human rises in the morning their minds
reset to a degree. Since we spirits cannot sleep, it's hard to imagine
what it's like, but apparently it's a glorious thing that the Enemy
ruthlessly held back from us. The human has a certain amount of
willpower to use up throughout the day. Each task consumes a certain
amount of willpower, and willpower is sapped when a human does something
selfish, over eats, or skips a workout. After the human does something
like this, willpower leaks out and the rest of the human's day snowballs
with more selfishness, until he recharges the next night (damn that
sleep!)

The human spends his life in the same manner that he spends his day (a
fractal property...keep your patient away from mathematics at all
costs!). You can exploit this by making small cuts into your patient's
faith, if you've kept him comfy long enough. If he doesn't speak up when
his church slowly turns away from the Enemy, he will be much more
susceptible to our tactics: first he skips church occassionally, then he
starts to harbor contempt for those that go when he doesn't. then he
stops going all together. Before long he's snowballed into a loyal
warlock!

I think you should adjust your strategy accordingly, and adopt this more
gradual strategy. After all, humans are living longer, and the longer
they live, the more time we have to work on them.

SUBJECT: Something for you to try...

Dear Mugwort,

I see that you've been able to keep your human in a state of despair for
some time now. Excellent! I'm proud of you. In fact, I brought you up in
a meeting at corporate last week. We were discussing additions to our
young professionals networking program, and I touted you, Mugwort, as a
worthy addition to the group. It's a great program for building your
career -- and a fast track to a lower management role. Would you rather
spend eternity whispering, suggesting, begging these filthy creatures to
sink down into our miry pit, or would you rather call the shots at
corporate with me? strategizing and building the future of the
Underworld? Down here, my scaly apprentice, the muck is always blacker.

I've come across some research that points to more opportunities opening
up for us on earth. One of our greatest ancillary weapons since VG Day
(Victory in the Garden) has been *pharmakeia*, the cutting of roots --
drugs as the humans say. Recently, the humans have went from demonizing
psychedelics -- our most useful drug -- to praising it; even referring
to it as *medicine*. Hahaha.

You may rightly wonder why the humans have changed their tune on
something they have universally shunned for so long. It started after
the second great war when science was largely compromised on earth. As
soon as the military funnelled untold millions into the university
system to support the war, science was no longer Newton, or Pastuer, or
Pascal, it was a commodity; bought and sold like politicians. Science
and scientists had a taste of the wine, the sturporous drunkenness, and
their eyes were filled with purple and scarlet.

Since then, we've been able to bribe the researchers and scientists to
find some positive uses for these drugs to treat certain ailments, like
anxiety and depression. This provides a peek through the window shades
to one of our underlying strategies that has been so effective, which is
of course to introduce a barb such as LSD or DMT or marijuana in a way
that the negative effects are initially ignored in favor of the positive
effects. *This marijuana will help my nausea, so what if I get a little
paranoid?* The beauty of a barbed tool such a this is that it slides in
easily, but the nasty stuff stays with the patient long after they try
to pry it out.

Your patient is young, he thinks himself smart. He is part of the crowd
who looks down his nose at prescription medication, which he sees as
part of the corporate machine designed to poison him. This is why I
think he'll be likely to try something like pot if a friend offers it. I
mean, hell, it's legal in half the country now, maybe all you need to do
is wait for a road trip with his buddies and use the old peer pressure
tricks.

However you do it, make it seem like an "organic" experience; marijuana
grows in nature, so how could it be bad? It's been used for 1000's of
years in indigenous cultures; it's the wicked Victorian Europeans and
American Puritans who wanted to hide the truth from the masses! His own
God even said that he has been given "every plant for food?"

These lukewarm Christians can't be tempted into trying these things in
the same way as the others, who still fall for the original trick: that
their "eyes will be opened" so that they'll be like the Enemy. But
remember that your young patient *has a choice*. He has to choose these
things, choose to disobey the Enemy in order to choose us. And when he
hears the stories of healing from these drugs in hip ceremonies in South
America or down the street, he'll make the right choice. We've already
grabbed most of the internet celebrities your patient looks up to. As
soon as he hears that podcaster so-and-so had his life changed by a
"religuos experience" with a shaman, it will be hard for him to resist.
He's young and niaive enough to not be able to discern the difference
between experiencing our nauseating Enemy firsthand and experiencing you
and I,and by the time he finds out, it will be too late for him anyway.

When and if you are able to get this hook into the lad, a few things
will happen. First, you will have *direct access* to him. No longer will
you be forced to whisper so subtly to him, you can have a conversation
with him and control parts of his senses almost directly. With
marijuana, that direct connection is a little unstable, compared to the
high speed connection we enjoy with some of the stronger drugs. There
exists a small handful of these that allow us almost unlimited control
of the lucky patient for a few minutes at a time. A few minutes might
seem like a trifle, but in those few minutes he's in *our world*, where
time is ours to meld how we see fit. While he's in this state we can see
his entire past, therefore it is easy for us to dig up some relevant
nugget of repressed memory, spin it around a bit, and make it seem like
the patient had a "breakthrough" -- a good word to get him used to, by
the way.

The other thing is that you can have a bit of fun with him. Scare him,
find his greatest fear and make him experience it over and over again.
Give him a taste of what death is like. Once he steps through that
portal, the laws of time and space don't apply in that space you share
with him. Some veteran tempters view this as their version of school
recess that they enjoyed as young spirits. Live a little, Mugwort!

But wait, there's more! Numerous secondary effects can also work to our
advantage.

First of all, many of these drugs will make your man plain lazy --
sloth. Let him spend his life laying around and you'll be sure to make
his displease the enemy. Next, you can fill him with incredible amounts
of fear as he drifts from his world into ours. Of course, try not to
make him afraid the first few times; get him hooked before the sugar
turns to vingar.

You may be happy to learn that humans share a most miserable trait with
us: that inability to be satisfied (after you win your first soul,
you'll know what I'm talking about.) If you give them x amount of a
drug, they will eventually need x + 1 to get the same level of arousal,
and then x + 2, and so on. This is a beauty because they will never be
satisfied with anything on this earth. As they try to chase the elusive
high that first hooked them, they become more and more focused on
*self*. The more they focus inward, the easier our job becomes. The
worship of *self* is the same as the worship of our Great Father Below.

Get him to try it, Mugwort, and you'll be well on your way.
