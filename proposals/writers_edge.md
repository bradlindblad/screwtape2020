(Working Title: Screwtape 2020)

Mugwort is the cousin of the now-deceased tempter Wormwood. Mugwort grew up hearing of his cousin's untimely demise due to subpar devilling, and he's determined to win the soul of the equally young human he's just been assigned by Corporate.

Fortunately, Chief Technical Officer Screwtape is willing to assist Mugwort in his quest, which we find in this series of interoffice emails. The world has changed drastically in the last 80 years, and the Underworld has made leaps and bounds in the fields of distraction, entertainment and idolatry, which *should* make Mugwort's job a little easier. 

The patient assigned to Mugwort is an American man in his early 20's, brought up in the Church and still in the Enemy's protection. Screwtape advises Mugwort to immediately begin a distraction campaign complete with mind-numbing screen time, social media and other pointless distractions. Not only does this occupy prime real estate in the patient's mind, but it also destroys his attention span and ability or desire to pray, effectively cutting of communications with the Enemy.

With the elements of distraction firmly in place, the devils begin to work on cutting the patient's ties to his church, which is a ever-present threat to their work. The opportunity arises to visit a friend's church, which happily preaches a watered-down gospel to the delight of Screwtape. They urge the patient to pay close attention to his feelings during and after the service. This way, the patient's primary focus is on how he *feels*, and not worship.

The effects of the distractions begin to have a pleasant side-effect: the patient begins to experience anxiety, primarily from social media and the news cycle. Screwtape explains to Mugwort how the media system has advanced in recent years from a once reliable and useful channel of relevant news and entertainment, to a fear and anxiety-inducing terror-delivery mechanism with the sole purpose of leaving humans ina constant state of apprehension. Subsequent emails from Screwtape showcase various methods Mugwort can use to exploit this asset to the fullest.

In his anxious state, the patient is diagnosed with a dangerous disease. We arent'y told explicitly, but gather that it's either cancer or an autoimmune disease. This excites the naive tempter, but the more experienced Screwtape makes it clear that the patient's ill health may hurt their cause more than help it, as serious earthly pains often bring the humans closer to the Enemy.

In an effort to capitalize on the illness and pull the patient down further, Screwtape advises to employ various new age healing remedies to assist with the patient's pain and anxiety, including meditation, yoga, hypnosis and others. The sickness goes into remission and life goes back to normal for the patient, until a chance meeting with a stranger who makes a Christ-like sacrifice for him, sealing his heart in Grace. A sudden complication from the illness then forever places the patient in the Enemy's arms, sealing Mugwort's fate forever.
